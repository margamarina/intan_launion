                In the interest of everyone’s health and well-being, the
                Philippines Department of Tourism (DOT) ensures that tourism
                stakeholders comply with the protocols and precautionary
                measures set by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the
                Department of Health (DOH). The DOT also actively promotes
                simple but effective habits that the public can adapt to help
                contain the spread of Covid-19.
              </p>
              <p>
                In recognition of the DOT’s efforts to align with global
                standards for health, safety and hygiene, we have been awarded
                the use of the Safe Travels Stamp from the World Travel and
                Tourism Council (WTTC).
              </p>
              <p>
                Created in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, the WTTC’s Safe
                Travels Stamp enables tourists to recognize destinations that
                meet international standards for health and safety, allowing
                visitors to confidently enjoy safe travels.
